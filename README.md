- Go, used by most new startups and `FAANG` are loving it
- Ideal for cloud infrastructure
- Golang is compiled
    - Gotool can run file directly without VM
    - Executables are different for OS
- System apps to web apps can be build - Cloud  ( mostly used in google products )
- Already in production
- Next Gen Language, entirely diff so don't bring other lang baggage
- Object Oriented? Yes and No, no classes but there are structs
    - no overrides in go lang
- What is missing in Go? Try/catch, but in reality you don't need it. Lexer does a lot of work
    - no semicolons, even docs say use it :P but lexer does all the work
- Golang installation and hello world
- go mod init is kinda npm init
- Go is super case sensitive
